	<h3 class ="intro"> Page margins set the default territory your text occupies on the page. Because they determine the maximum width of the text block, page margins have the greatest effect on line length. (Point size also affects line length, though more finely.) As page margins increase, line length decreases, and vice versa. </h3>

	<h6 class ="sidenote"> [Note: A gutter margin is extra space on the inner edge of a page, used to account for a binding. In a duplex (two-sided) document, the gutter margin will automatically alternate sides. ] </h6>

	<h4 class="crosshead">In Print </h4> <p class="bodycopy">
Most word processors default to page margins of one inch. On standard 8.5″ × 11″ paper, that produces a line length of 6.5″. That was fine for the monospaced fonts of the typewriter era, which used a lot of horizontal space. But for proportional fonts, they’re too small. 
At 12 point, left and right page margins of 1.5-2.0″ will usually give you a comfortable line length. But don’t take that range as an absolute—focus on getting the number of characters per line into the right range (see line length). The smaller the point size, the larger the page margins will need to be, and vice versa. </p>

<h4 class="crosshead">On The Web </h4> <p class="bodycopy">
Originally, web browsers had no concept of margins—text simply flowed from one edge of the window to the other. That wasn’t a huge problem at the time, because computer screens were much smaller. With the advent of CSS, web designers could use the margin and padding properties to create space between text and the edge of its containing block.</p>
<br>
<p class ="qna"> “But if I use bigger margins, won’t a lot of
the page be empty?” 
Sure. Is that a problem? </p>
